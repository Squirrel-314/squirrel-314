Hi! I'm a web developer, well technically a student but whatever.  
If you want to learn more about me and my work, check out my [personal site](https://editorrust.github.io)  

I'm working on two major projects right now, Git Organized and some Chat Experiments. 

[Git Organized](https://github.com/editorrust/git-organized) is a project planning and managment tool built for developers. Go check out the repository! Still in very early beta.  
[ Chat Experiments](https://github.com/editorrust/chat-playground) is a project to mess around with Socket.io, encryption, and things, with lots of other ideas and plans.  

I'm looking for help with Git Organized!  
You can email me at editorrust@gmail.com :)  

### "Fun" information...
- Markdown!
- USB-C is just about the coolest thing ever
- Material 3 looks bad
