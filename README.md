## Heeeeeeeey! Hi! Hello! Hi again!
### So nice to see you!

Hi! I'm Editor Rust, welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Blogs are for the self-centered, so I decided to write an autobiography.  
I put some information here, but if you want more check out my [personal site](https://editorrust.github.io)  
I pinned my favorite repositories, you can check them out if you have time!

I'm a web developer, well techincally a student but whatever. All that matters here is what you build!  

I'm working on two major projects right now, Git Organized and some Chat Experiments.
[Git Organized](https://github.com/editorrust/git-organized) is a project planning and managment tool built for developers. I'm really excieted about this, go check out the repository! It's clearly not ready for use, but I' working on it.  

[ Chat Experiments](https://github.com/editorrust/chat-playground) is a project to mess around with Socket.io, encryption, and other cool features, which plans to evetually have a politics-free global chat, Discord-style servers for communities, direct messaging for friends and family, and Disqus-esque built-in chats for websites.  

Some other projects I've worked on... 
- [Gold Rush!](https://github.com/editorrust/gold-rush) My clicker game, it's no cookie clicker, but it got me on my webdev journey
- [Vegetable Dash!](https://github.com/editorrust/vegetable-dash) You'll always have a place in my heart, and a dusty corner of the web
- [digit.js](https://github.com/editorrust/digit), a JS number library! Still working on this :)
