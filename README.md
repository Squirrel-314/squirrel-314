## Heeeeeeeey! Hi! Hello! Hi again!
### So nice to see you!

Hi! I'm Editor Rust, welcome to my GitHub profile!  
If you want to learn more about meand my work, check out my personal site -> [personal site](https://editorrust.github.io)  

## Here's the rundown: 

I pinned my favorite repositories, check them out if you have time!
I'm a web developer, well techincally a student but whatever. All that matters here is what you build!  

I'm working on two major projects right now, Git Organized and some Chat Experiments.  
[Git Organized](https://github.com/editorrust/git-organized) is a project planning and managment tool built for developers. I'm really excieted about this, go check out the repository! It's clearly not ready for use, but I' working on it.  

[ Chat Experiments](https://github.com/editorrust/chat-playground) is a project to mess around with Socket.io, encryption, and other cool features, which plans to evetually have a politics-free global chat, Discord-style servers for communities, direct messaging for friends and family, and Disqus-esque built-in chats for websites.  

It's nice to see more and more people with these personal markdown files.
