## Heeeeeeeey! Hi! Hello! Hi again!
### So nice to see you!

Hi! I'm Editor Squirrel, and this is my GitHub profile!  
Blogs are for the self-centered, so I decided to write an autobiography.  
I pinned my favorite repositories, you can check them out if you have time!

I'm a web developer, well techincally a student but whatever. All that matters here is what you build!  
I'm working on a couple projects right now, mostly [Git Organized!](https://github.com/editorrust/git-organized) & [chat experiments](https://github.com/editorrust/chat-playground). I'm working on chat expirements to mess around with Socket.io , encryption, and other cool features, and evetually I'll integrate the resulting chat into all my apps.  

My dreams projects are Git Organized & a secret project which will help open source developers find projects to contribute to. So I'm working on Git Organized now! No need to wait for my dreams :)  
But what is Git Organzied? A project planning tool! You should totally go check out the repository. It's not even near usable yet, but I'm working on it!  

Some other projects I've worked on... 
- [Gold Rush!](https://github.com/editorrust/gold-rush) My clicker game, it's no cookie clicker, but it got me on my webdev journey
- [Vegetable Dash!](https://github.com/editorrust/vegetable-dash) You'll always have a place in my heart, and a dusty corner of the web
- [digit.js](https://github.com/editorrust/digit), a JS number library! Still working on this :)
- [Hillside Township site!](https://github.com/hillside-township/hillside-township.github.io) Satire & premium citizenship
