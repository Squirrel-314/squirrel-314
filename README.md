## Heeeeeeeey! Hi! Hello! Hi again!
### So nice to see you!

Hi! I'm Editor Squirrel, and this is my GitHub profile!  
Blogs are for the self-centered, so I decided to write an autobiography.  
I pinned my favorite repositories, you can check them out if you have time!

I'm a web developer, well techincally a student but whatever. All that matters here is what you build!  
I'm working on a couple projects right now, mostly [Git Organized!](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/git-organized) (Soooo cool! & free & open source! üòä) & [Chat expirements!](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/chat-playground-thing-yay). I'm working on chat expirements to mess around with Socket.io and other cool features, and evetually I'll integrate the resulting chat into all my apps.  

My dreams projects are Git Organized & a secret project which will help open source developers find projects to contribute to. So I'm working on Git Organized now! No need to wait for my dreams :)  
But what is Git Organzied? A project planning tool! You should totally go check out the repository. It's not even near usability yet, but I'm working on it!  

Some other projects I've worked on are 
- [Gold Rush!](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/gold-rush) My clicker game, it's no cookie clicker, but I'm working on it!
- [Vegetable Dash!](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/vegetable-dash) You'll always have a place in my heart, and a dusty corner of the web
- [digit.js](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/digit), a JS number library! Still working on this üòÅ
- [Hillside Township site!](https://github.com/hillside-township/hillside-township.github.io) So cool... such a clean, nice, design...
- [Cookin' in the Kitchen](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/cookin-in-the-kitchen), a really cool dragging and SVG experiment
- [Glish Translate](https://github.com/Squirrel-314/glish-translate) Chrome extension experiments, just for fun. I still want to work on this, but, priorities!

 
üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
- Advanced JavaScript features! Promises, Classes, here I COME!
- Node! Express! Always room for improvment!
- Swift! 'Cause it's cool! ‚≠ê
- Socket.io, Web Sockets!
- Vue & Typescript! So I can contribute to my new faviorite open source project [octo.app](https://github.com/voracious/octo)! Wow that developer is amazing.

I know...  
GitHub, GitLab, Blender, Inkscape, Procreate, Atom, VS Code, Windows 7, 10, and 11, MacOS basics, Kubuntu Linux, my way around a Linux terminal, iPadOS.  
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Ejs, Socket.io, Git (working on commands!)


I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open source projects! üíñ  
I'm also looking for help with my pet project, Git Organized! I have high hopes that probably won't be possible without help. Just sayin'! Pls pls pls

You may refer to me as "that goshdarned developer" or "not *them* again".  
If you want to contact me you can use this email address: hamza.elabi1@gmail.com  
...or just create an issue on one of my really old repositories =)

‚ö° Fun info: ...
- Markdown enthusiast! (what next, font fanatic? ummm... üòä)
- I really like the new Windows 11 emojis! Apple could take some notes...
- I like Linux, and Apple's clean design, and rainbows, and programming! Ok, you probably don't want this much insight into my life. Whatever! I'll put it here anyway, if only for me
