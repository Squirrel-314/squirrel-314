## Here's the rundown: 

I pinned my favorite repositories, check them out if you have time!  
I'm a web developer, well techincally a student but whatever.  

I'm working on two major projects right now, Git Organized and some Chat Experiments. 

[Git Organized](https://github.com/editorrust/git-organized) is a project planning and managment tool built for developers. I'm really excited about this, go check out the repository! Still in very early beta.  

[ Chat Experiments](https://github.com/editorrust/chat-playground) is a project to mess around with Socket.io, encryption, and other cool features, which plans to evetually have a global chat, Discord-style servers for communities, direct messaging for friends and family, and Disqus-esque built-in chats for websites.

I'm learning advanced JavaScript concepts, along with many Node libraries. Also learning about Socket.io and websockets, with plans to learn more about web protocols and such. I'm learning Vue, then eventually React, TypeScript, and Angular. I also really want to learn more about the terminal, to use for git and file browsing. PowerShell sucks! The Linux terminal is the height of perfection.  
I plan on learning Rust, as well as more about cybersecurity in general. At some point I want to learn machine learning and Python, as well as app devlopment in Swift. And more JavaScript libraries.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source Node projects! Please contact me if you have a project you want help with.  
I'm also looking for help with Git Organized!  

You may refer to me as "that goshdarned developer" or "not *them* again".  
You can email me at editorrust@gmail.com :)  

## "Fun" info...
- Markdown enthusiast!
- Terminal and key commands person. Last time I actually clicked on a tab to reach it was *ages* ago
- Open source and Linux fan!
- I enjoy Apple's clean design and easy UI, but being a developer makes it impossible to comfortably their restrictive software. Also, PORTS!
- USB-C is just about the coolest thing ever
